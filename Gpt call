Ah, great question! The user is confused about HOW GPT knows to respond with "SQL:" or "CLARIFICATION_NEEDED:" or "CONFIRM:" as prefixes. This is crucial to understand - it's not magic, it's because we EXPLICITLY INSTRUCT GPT in the prompt to respond in that format.

Let me explain clearly that:
1. We tell GPT in the system prompt to use these specific prefixes
2. GPT follows our instructions and formats its response accordingly
3. Then our code can parse these prefixes

I need to show the actual prompt instructions that make GPT respond this way.

Excellent question! This is a crucial point - GPT doesn't automatically respond with "SQL:" or "CLARIFICATION_NEEDED:". **You have to explicitly tell GPT to use these prefixes in your prompt instructions.**

Let me show you exactly how this works:

## **How GPT Learns to Use These Prefixes**

### **In Your Prompt, You Give Explicit Instructions**

```python
def build_complete_prompt(user_input):
    schema_info = get_schema_with_values()
    
    prompt = f"""
You are an intelligent text-to-SQL converter with entity normalization.

DATABASE SCHEMA:
{schema_info}

ENTITY NORMALIZATION RULES:
1. Countries: US/USA → United States, UK → United Kingdom
2. Companies: Match against available database values

CRITICAL: You MUST respond in one of these EXACT formats:

FORMAT 1 - When you can generate SQL (all entities are clear):
SQL: [your sql query here]

FORMAT 2 - When you need clarification (entity is unclear/not found):
CLARIFICATION_NEEDED: [explain what's unclear and show available options]

FORMAT 3 - When you need confirmation (uncertain match):
CONFIRM: Did you mean '[user_term]' as '[database_term]'?

EXAMPLES OF HOW TO RESPOND:

Example 1 - Clear query:
User: "show Apple Inc revenue"
Your response: SQL: SELECT revenue FROM companies WHERE company_name = 'Apple Inc.'

Example 2 - Entity not found:
User: "show companies from xyz"
Your response: CLARIFICATION_NEEDED: Could not find country 'xyz'. Available countries: United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany

Example 3 - Uncertain match:
User: "show Gogle revenue"
Your response: CONFIRM: Did you mean 'Gogle' as 'Google LLC'? (88% similarity)

USER INPUT: "{user_input}"

Remember: Start your response with EXACTLY one of these: "SQL:", "CLARIFICATION_NEEDED:", or "CONFIRM:"
"""
    
    return prompt
```

## **Step-by-Step: How It Works**

### **Step 1: You Define Response Formats in the Prompt**

In your system prompt, you explicitly tell GPT:

```
CRITICAL: You MUST respond in one of these EXACT formats:

FORMAT 1: SQL: [query]
FORMAT 2: CLARIFICATION_NEEDED: [message]
FORMAT 3: CONFIRM: [message]
```

### **Step 2: GPT Follows Your Instructions**

When you call GPT with this prompt:

```python
user_input = "show companies from xyz"

# Your prompt tells GPT: "If entity not found, respond with CLARIFICATION_NEEDED:"
gpt_response = call_gpt(user_input, prompt)

# GPT reads your instructions and responds:
# "CLARIFICATION_NEEDED: Could not find country 'xyz'. Available: United States, Canada"
```

### **Step 3: Your Code Parses the Response**

```python
# Now you can check the prefix:
if gpt_response.startswith("SQL:"):
    # GPT was able to generate SQL
elif gpt_response.startswith("CLARIFICATION_NEEDED:"):
    # GPT needs clarification
```

## **Real Example with Full Flow**

### **Example 1: Entity Not Found**

```python
# User query
user_input = "show companies from xyz"

# Your prompt (simplified)
prompt = """
You are text-to-SQL converter.

DATABASE VALUES:
Countries: United States, United Kingdom, Canada

RESPONSE FORMATS:
- If entity not found: CLARIFICATION_NEEDED: [message]
- If SQL can be generated: SQL: [query]

USER INPUT: "show companies from xyz"
"""

# Send to GPT
gpt_response = call_gpt(user_input, prompt)

# GPT reads your prompt and thinks:
# "User said 'xyz' but I only have: United States, United Kingdom, Canada"
# "My instructions say: if entity not found, use CLARIFICATION_NEEDED:"
# "So I'll respond with that format"

# GPT responds:
# "CLARIFICATION_NEEDED: Could not find country 'xyz'. Available: United States, United Kingdom, Canada"

# Your code checks:
if gpt_response.startswith("CLARIFICATION_NEEDED:"):  # TRUE!
    return {"type": "clarification", "message": gpt_response}
```

### **Example 2: Successful SQL Generation**

```python
# User query
user_input = "show Apple Inc revenue"

# Your prompt (simplified)
prompt = """
You are text-to-SQL converter.

DATABASE VALUES:
Companies: Apple Inc., Google LLC, Microsoft Corporation

RESPONSE FORMATS:
- If entity found and SQL can be generated: SQL: [query]
- If entity not found: CLARIFICATION_NEEDED: [message]

USER INPUT: "show Apple Inc revenue"
"""

# Send to GPT
gpt_response = call_gpt(user_input, prompt)

# GPT reads your prompt and thinks:
# "User said 'Apple Inc' and that exists in my database values"
# "My instructions say: if entity found, use SQL: format"
# "So I'll respond with that format"

# GPT responds:
# "SQL: SELECT revenue FROM companies WHERE company_name = 'Apple Inc.'"

# Your code checks:
if gpt_response.startswith("SQL:"):  # TRUE!
    sql = gpt_response.split("SQL:", 1)[1].strip()
    return execute_query(sql)
```

## **Why This Works: Prompt Engineering**

This technique is called **structured output formatting**. You're training GPT to respond in a predictable way:

```python
# BAD PROMPT (unpredictable responses):
prompt = "Generate SQL for this query"
# GPT might respond:
# "Here's the SQL: SELECT..."
# "The query would be: SELECT..."
# "I think you want: SELECT..."
# Hard to parse!

# GOOD PROMPT (predictable responses):
prompt = """
Generate SQL and start your response with exactly "SQL: "

Examples:
User: "show revenue"
Response: SQL: SELECT revenue FROM companies
"""
# GPT will respond:
# "SQL: SELECT revenue FROM companies"
# Easy to parse!
```

## **Complete Working Example**

Here's a complete example showing how everything connects:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="your-key")

def build_prompt_with_format_instructions(user_input):
    """Build prompt that tells GPT exactly how to format responses"""
    
    # Get available database values
    available_countries = ["United States", "United Kingdom", "Canada", "Germany"]
    available_companies = ["Apple Inc.", "Google LLC", "Microsoft Corporation"]
    
    prompt = f"""
You are a text-to-SQL converter.

DATABASE SCHEMA:
Table: companies
Columns: company_name, country, revenue, year

AVAILABLE VALUES:
- Countries: {', '.join(available_countries)}
- Companies: {', '.join(available_companies)}

RESPONSE FORMAT RULES (CRITICAL):
You MUST start your response with one of these EXACT prefixes:

1. If you CAN generate SQL (all entities are found and clear):
   Start with: SQL:
   Example: SQL: SELECT revenue FROM companies WHERE company_name = 'Apple Inc.'

2. If you CANNOT find an entity in the database:
   Start with: CLARIFICATION_NEEDED:
   Example: CLARIFICATION_NEEDED: Could not find country 'xyz'. Available: United States, United Kingdom, Canada

3. If you found a SIMILAR match but want confirmation:
   Start with: CONFIRM:
   Example: CONFIRM: Did you mean 'Appl' as 'Apple Inc.'?

USER QUERY: "{user_input}"

NOW RESPOND:
"""
    
    return prompt

def text_to_sql_with_format(user_input):
    """Complete flow showing how format instructions work"""
    
    # Build prompt with explicit format instructions
    prompt = build_prompt_with_format_instructions(user_input)
    
    # Call GPT
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
        ],
        temperature=0.1
    )
    
    gpt_response = response.choices[0].message.content
    
    print(f"User input: {user_input}")
    print(f"GPT response: {gpt_response}")
    print()
    
    # Parse based on prefix that GPT was instructed to use
    if gpt_response.startswith("SQL:"):
        sql = gpt_response.split("SQL:", 1)[1].strip()
        return {"type": "sql", "query": sql}
    
    elif gpt_response.startswith("CLARIFICATION_NEEDED:"):
        message = gpt_response.split("CLARIFICATION_NEEDED:", 1)[1].strip()
        return {"type": "clarification", "message": message}
    
    elif gpt_response.startswith("CONFIRM:"):
        message = gpt_response.split("CONFIRM:", 1)[1].strip()
        return {"type": "confirmation", "message": message}
    
    else:
        return {"type": "error", "message": "GPT didn't follow format instructions"}

# Test it:
print("=== Test 1: Entity Found ===")
result1 = text_to_sql_with_format("show Apple Inc revenue")
# GPT sees: "Apple Inc." is in available companies
# GPT responds: "SQL: SELECT revenue FROM companies WHERE company_name = 'Apple Inc.'"

print("=== Test 2: Entity Not Found ===")
result2 = text_to_sql_with_format("show companies from xyz")
# GPT sees: "xyz" is NOT in available countries
# GPT responds: "CLARIFICATION_NEEDED: Could not find country 'xyz'. Available: United States, United Kingdom, Canada"

print("=== Test 3: Uncertain Match ===")
result3 = text_to_sql_with_format("show Appl revenue")
# GPT sees: "Appl" is similar to "Apple Inc."
# GPT responds: "CONFIRM: Did you mean 'Appl' as 'Apple Inc.'?"
```

## **Key Takeaway**

The prefixes like "SQL:", "CLARIFICATION_NEEDED:", and "CONFIRM:" don't come from GPT automatically. **You explicitly instruct GPT to use these prefixes in your prompt**, and GPT follows your instructions.

Think of it like giving someone a form to fill out:

```
Bad instructions: "Tell me about the query"
Response: Could be anything!

Good instructions: "Start your answer with either 'YES:' or 'NO:' followed by explanation"
Response: Predictable format you can parse!
```

Does this clarify how GPT knows to use those prefixes?
