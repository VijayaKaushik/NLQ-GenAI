The user wants to add business definitions and domain knowledge at the column level during the data load process. This would help with:

Better AI query generation - the LLM would understand what each column represents from a business perspective
Domain knowledge capture - business users can add context that technical column names might not convey
Query guidance - providing context for how columns should be used or interpreted
Data governance - documenting the business meaning of data fields

I should add this feature to the configure screen where users are already setting up column configurations. This would be the most logical place since they're already looking at each column's technical properties.
I'll need to:

Add business definition fields to the column configuration table
Include examples of good business definitions
Add guidance on what kind of information would be helpful
Maybe add some predefined templates or suggestions
Show how this information would be used in the AI system

Let me update the configure screen to include this feature.Excellent idea! Adding business definitions and domain knowledge at the column level will significantly improve AI query generation. Let me enhance the Configure screen to include this feature.Strategized updating sheets with business definitions and metadata.Now I need to update the other sheets with business definitions as well, and then modify the column configuration table to include these new fields. Let me add the business definitions to the other sheets too.Strategized updating products sheet with business definitions.Now let me update the products sheet columns with business definitions as well.Strategized column configuration update for business definitionsNow I need to update the column configuration table in the renderConfigureStep function to include the new business definition fields.

Now I need to add a quick template/suggestion feature to help users understand what kind of business definitions they should add. Let me also add some pre-filled examples and suggestions for common column types.Devised intelligent function for business column definition suggestionsNow I need to add the getBusinessDefinitionSuggestions function that will provide intelligent suggestions based on column names and types.Pondered restoring updateColumnConfig function after adding suggestions.I need to make sure the updateColumnConfig function is still there after adding the suggestions function. Let me add it back.Excel Upload & Configuration InterfaceInteractive artifact ∙ Version 5 Engineered robust business definition feature for Excel upload UIPerfect! Now I've added a comprehensive business definitions feature to the Excel upload UI. Let me summarize what I've added:

Enhanced column configuration with business definitions
Three key business fields: Business Definition, Domain Knowledge, and Query Guidance
Pre-filled examples for common business scenarios
Auto-suggest functionality based on column names and types
Clear guidance on why business definitions are important
Better visual layout with expandable column cards

This feature will significantly improve the AI's ability to understand and work with the business data by providing rich context that goes beyond just technical column names and types.Perfect! I've enhanced the Configure screen with comprehensive Business Definition & Domain Knowledge capabilities. Here's what I've added:
🎯 New Business Definition Features:
📋 Three Key Business Context Fields:

Business Definition (Required):

What the column represents in business terms
Example: "Customer's primary billing address used for invoicing"


Domain Knowledge:

Business rules, constraints, valid values, update frequency
Example: "Updated nightly from ERP. Values: Active, Inactive, Suspended"


Query Guidance:

How AI should use this column in queries and analysis
Example: "Use for customer segmentation, regional analysis, and territory management"



🤖 Smart Auto-Suggest Feature:

Intelligent Suggestions: Click "💡 Auto-suggest" for context-aware recommendations
Pattern Recognition: Recognizes common patterns like CustomerID, Email, OrderDate
Type-Based Logic: Provides relevant suggestions based on data types
Pre-filled Examples: All demo columns already have business definitions

💡 Why This Feature is Game-Changing:
Better AI Query Generation:

AI understands "Show customers with high revenue" vs "Show records where field_23 > 1000"
Context-aware suggestions and responses
Reduced need for clarification questions

Enhanced Data Governance:

Documents business rules and constraints
Provides context for new team members
Improves data quality and consistency

Real-World Example:
Column: "TotalAmount"
Business Definition: "Total monetary value including tax"
Domain Knowledge: "Always in USD. Includes taxes, excludes shipping"
Query Guidance: "Use for revenue analysis and financial reporting"

Result: AI can answer "What's our average order value?" intelligently
🚀 How It Works in the AI System:
This business context becomes part of the AI prompt templates for query generation:

Column descriptions inform query logic
Domain knowledge prevents incorrect assumptions
Query guidance suggests appropriate use cases
Business definitions improve natural language understanding

Try clicking the "💡 Auto-suggest" buttons to see intelligent suggestions, or check out the pre-filled examples already in the demo data!RetryVGive me a skeleton of prompt for SQL generation for using the information captured on the UIEditCrafted comprehensive SQL generation prompt template frameworkThe user wants me to create a skeleton prompt template for SQL generation that would utilize all the information captured in the UI we've been designing. This would include:

Business definitions
Domain knowledge

Let me create one more artifact showing the key components and benefits of this approach, as well as how it would integrate with the overall system architecture.Here's the complete SQL Generation Prompt Framework leveraging all the business context captured in our UI!
🎯 Key Components of the Prompt:
1. Schema Context

Table Definitions: Business purpose + technical structure
Column Metadata: Data types, constraints, relationships
Business Definitions: What each field means in business terms
Domain Knowledge: Rules, valid values, update patterns
Query Guidance: How AI should use each column

2. Relationship Intelligence

Relationship Map: All detected/manual relationships
Confidence Scores: Auto-detected vs manual relationships
Business Context: Why relationships exist
Join Strategies: Optimal ways to connect tables

3. Business Logic Integration

Intent Classification: Understanding what user wants
Entity Mapping: Translating business terms to technical fields
Domain Constraints: Applying business rules in queries
Performance Guidance: Using metadata for optimization

🚀 How This Transforms AI Query Generation:
Before (Without Business Context):
User: "Show me high-value customers"
AI: "What do you mean by 'high-value'? Which column contains customer data?"
After (With Business Context):
sql-- High-value customers (AI understands business context)
SELECT 
    c.company_name as "Company Name",
    c.contact_name as "Primary Contact",
    SUM(o.total_amount) as "Total Revenue",
    COUNT(o.order_id) as "Order Count",
    ROUND(AVG(o.total_amount), 2) as "Average Order Value"
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.status NOT IN ('Cancelled', 'Returned')  -- Business rule
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.company_name, c.contact_name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amount) > 10000  -- High-value threshold
ORDER BY "Total Revenue" DESC;
💡 Prompt Integration Strategy:
Dynamic Population

    prompt = prompt.replace("{USER_QUESTION}", user_question)
    
    # Populate table definitions
    for table in schema_metadata.tables:
        table_section = build_table_section(table)
        prompt += table_section
    
    # Add relationship mappings
    relationships = build_relationship_section(schema_metadata.relationships)
    prompt = prompt.replace("{RELATIONSHIPS_MAP}", relationships)
    
    return prompt
LLM Integration
